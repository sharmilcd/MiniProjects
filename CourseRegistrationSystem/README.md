This project implements a basic Course Registration System in C++. It supports student and course management with features like prerequisite checking, enrollment with slot conflict handling, and waitlisting.

v1.cpp: A simpler version with core enrollment logic.

v2.cpp: An extended version with waitlist and drop functionality.

Ideal for understanding object-oriented design, data structures (unordered_map, unordered_set, queue), and implementing logic-based constraints in academic systems.
